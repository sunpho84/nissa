TODO-LIST (not in relevance order)

-add fully the chemical potentials and magnetic fields, since they are not defined
 in particular:
 *define the u1 fields in the main file
 *check that no additional operation is needed when applying dirac operator and computing force

-add saving of seed

-decide whether to move staggered phase and/or boundary conditions into u1 fields

-decide how to choose the number of pseudo-fermions

-add self-tuning algorithm for number of MD steps

-improve eigenvalues determination

-add fermionic observables

-add polyakov loop and topology measurement

-add multi-step gauge integrator

-add possibility to save produced confs

-keep trace of trajectory id in the run
