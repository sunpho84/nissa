Introduction
------------

Nissa Is a Set of SU(3) Algorithm

Thread pool ideas, SPI and BGQ optimization taken from M.Kruse work

This project is host at: https://github.com/sunpho84/nissa/


Requirements
------------

-MPI distribution (at the moment also when running on scalar machine).
-Support for threads in the compiler.
-Autotools to generate configure and Makefile.


Compiling
---------

Compilation procede as in normal autotools way:

	    bash config/bootstrap
	    mkdir build
	    cd build
	    ../configure --help
	    ../configure  CXXFLAGS=... [flags]
	    make

The program have to be compiled with C++ including all the libraries and header necessary 
for MPI. Typically you can use some wrapper of the system compiler to avoid having to pass
all the paths and flags needed by MPI. Pass the name of such compiler wrapper through "MPICXX" 
parameter, e.g: "MPICXX=mpicxx". Optionally, pass the flag needed to activate OpenMP through
CXXFLAGS: if none are passed, they will be guessed.

On a typical PC therefore you should type something like:
 ../configure MPICXX=mpicxx CXXFLAGS="-fopenmp"

On BGQ machine (Turing and Fermi) use:
 ../configure MPICC=mpixlc_r MPICXX=mpixlcxx_r CXXFLAGS="-O3 -qstrict=all" --enable-bgq

When compiling using mpi intel compiler please set the flag: "CXXFLAGS=-DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK"


Structure
---------

The package is divided in various piecese, namely the "library", whose source are 
contained in "src" directory, and various projects and tools. This is the content of the 
various directories:

-doc: in principle this should contain documentation to each and everything, but at the moment
 only notes on some particular routine

-src: contains the library and all the routines common to the various programs (see below)

-tools: simple programs like converters, data check, etc

-projects: programs to perform massive computations

-test: dedicated programs to check the library (inside "nissa" sub-drectory),
 and also input files and reference data to check "tools" and "projects" programs

-work_in_prog: scratch area where to develop new programs


Detailed content of "src" directory:

-base: all the routines needed to initialize and close the package and
 communicate data, use vector, debug and generate random numbers; file 
 "global_variables.cpp" contains also all the variables common to the 
 package

-dirac_operators: dirac operators for twisted mass and staggered regularizations,
 in double and quadruple precisions (tm only)

-geometry: routines to move around on the lattice

-hmc: routines to generate new confs with hybrid monte carlo methods, stout staggered and quenched theories only

-inverters: multi-mass (cgm) and single mass (cg) inverters for twisted mass and staggered 
 Dirac operators, in double and quadruple precisions

-IO: routines to read and write ILDG files and to parse input files, and in general 
 to access to the filesystem

-linalgs: some linear algebra (not much indeed)

-new_types: this contains definitions of types (file: src/new_types/new_types_definitions.h)
 and routines working on new types (see various files, e.g. su3.cpp)     

-operations: routines to make contractions, fourier transform and fft, fix the gauge, smear,
 and compute gauge observables


All the files contained in the "src" directory are compiled and put together in the 
"libissa.a" library, in the main nissa directory. The program that want to use the "nissa"
library should link it and include "nissa.h" (located inside "src").
