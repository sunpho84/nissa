Introduction
------------

Nissa Is a Set of SU(3) Algorithm

This project is host at: http://code.google.com/p/nissa


Requirements
------------

Some sort of MPI distribution (at the moment also when running on scalar machine)


Compiling
---------

The program have to be compiled with c++.
At the moment, the compilation is still partially home-made.
Run the script "configure" and follow the instructions, then use the "make" command.
In case of need adapt the "Makefile" to your needs.

If you want to compile on BG/P add "-qarch -O2 -DBGP" as CGFLAS in the configure. 


Structure
---------

The package is divided in various piecese, namely the "library", contained in 
"src" directory, and various projects and tools. This is the content of the 
various directories:

-doc: in principle this should contain documentation to each and everything, but at the moment
 only notes on some particular routine

-src: contains the library and all the routines common to the various programs

-tools: simple programs like converters, data check, etc

-projects: programs to perform massive computations

-test: dedicated programs to check the library (inside "nissa" sub-drectory),
 and also input files and reference data to check "tools" and "projects" programs

-work_in_prog: scratch area where to develop new programs


Let's describe in more details the src directory:

-base: all the routines needed to initialize and close the package and
 communicate data, use vector, debug and generate random numbers; file 
 "global_variables.cpp" contains also all the variables common to the 
 package

-dirac_operators: dirac operators for twisted mass and staggered regularizations,
 in double and quadruple precisions (tm only)

-geometry: routines to move around on the lattice

-hmc: routines to generate new confs with hybrid monte carlo methods, staggered theory only

-inverters: multi-mass (cgm) and single mass (cg) inverters for twisted mass and staggered 
 Dirac operators, in double and quadruple precisions

-IO: routines to read and write ILDG files and to parse input files, and in general 
 to access to the filesystem

-linalgs: some linear algebra (not much indeed)

-new_types: this contains definitions of types (file: src/new_types/new_types_definitions.h)
 and routines working on new types (see various files, e.g. su3.cpp)     

-operations: routines to make contractions, fourier transform and fft, fix the gauge, smear,
 and compute gauge observables


All the files contained in the "src" directory are compiled and put together in the 
"libissa.a" file. The program that want to use the "nissa" library should link it and
include "nissa.h".
